Introduction to Functional Programming

Haskell is a modern functional programming language used by
companies like Facebook, Google, and The New York Times.
Though it is considered state of the art,
Haskell makes a great language, both to learn the basics
of programming and for building practical applications.

This course is intended to teach programming to non-programmers.
The goal is not to turn students into software engineers,
but rather to give them the tools of functional programming
to apply in their individual studies, careers, and daily lives.

Once the fundamentals are covered, students begin a series of micro projects,
which they themselves create and carryout.
These can range from anything from supporting their current class work
to analyzing the performance of their favorite Clarion sports team.
In this course, students are encouraged to apply programming to their individual interests.
