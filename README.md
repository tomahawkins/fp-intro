# Introduction to Functional Programming

Class homepage:  https://github.com/tomahawkins/fp-intro

## Prerequisites

* A laptop.
  * Bring it to class, open it up, and turn it on.  This class is hands on.
* A good text editor.
  * VIM or EMACS.  Please learn one or the other.
* A basic knowledge of your OS (Mac, Windows, Linux).
* No fear of the command line.
  * Terminal (Mac, Linux),  Command Prompt or Cygwin (Windows).
* The [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/) installed.

# Grading (let's pretend this class is for credit)

Final grade = 50% Homework + 50% Projects + 0% Tests

## Homework

* Due each day of class, i.e. when I check my email that afternoon.
* Homework is comprised of one (sometimes more) Haskell programming files
  exploring the programming problems of the day.
  * Try things!
  * Write comments.  What works, what doesn't.
    What do you understand?  What is confusing?
```haskell
-- This is a comment in haskell.
{- So is this. -}
```
* Submit homework to tomahawkins@gmail.com with subject: [fp-intro-homework] <date>
