# Introduction to Functional Programming and Haskell

Provide an introduction to
[functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
using [Haskell](http://haskell.org/) with an emphasis towards data analysis.

## Goals

To get to the point of being able to:

* Feel comfortable navigating the Unix/Linux command line (aka. Terminal).
* Create programs that read text, perform analysis, and print out results.
* Understand and break a problem down into a manageable sequence of steps:
  * What are the input data?
  * What are the results of the analysis?  How should they be presented?
  * What are the intermediate stages (datatypes) and steps (functions)?


## Prerequisites

No prior programming experience required.
Just a laptop running Mac or Linux with the [Haskell tools](http://www.haskell.org/downloads) installed.

## Useful Resources

### Linux Command Line (aka. Terminal, Bash Shell)

All our work is done from the Linux command line.  Just a basic understanding of 
how to navigate directories and manipulate files will suffice.

* [Linux Tutorial](http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/)

### Text and Code Editors

Though any text editor will do, learning [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) or [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
is recommended.

* [Interactive Vim Tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/)
* [Vim Tutorial](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/)

### Haskell Tutorials

* [Haskell WikiBook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell)
* [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
* [99 Haskell Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems): If you can do all 99, you're awesome!

### Haskell Groups for Questions, Answers, and Support

* [Haskell Mailing Lists](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Mailing_lists): The Haskell-Cafe and Beginners lists are great for newcomers.
* Haskell on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged?tagnames=haskell)
* [Lambda Ladies](http://www.lambdaladies.com/)
* [Pittsburgh Function Programming Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Functional-Programming-Meetup/)

### Haskell Resources

* [Hoogle](https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/): Search Haskell libraries by name or type signature.
* [Haskell Libraries](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/index.html): The standard libraries that come with GHC.
* [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/): A huge collection of various programs and libraries developed by the Haskell community.
